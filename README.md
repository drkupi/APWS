This repository contains the code for the [Asia Pacific Weather Statistics (APWS) application](https://hydra-water.shinyapps.io/APWS/).

APWS is a web-based Data as a Service (DaaS) application. The statistics data embedded within APWS is provided for use with SWAT (https://swat.tamu.edu) hydrologic models and / or the WXGN weather generator, for generating synthetic weather time-series for any location (or multiple locations) in the Asia Pacific region. The APWS application provides weather statistics at a 0.25 degree spatial resolution. The web portal is developed using Shiny (https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and allows users to select and download weather statistics (ready for use with the SWAT model) for any area within the Asia Pacific region.
